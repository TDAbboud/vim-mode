This is a work in progress branch that shows how to make Atom talk to Neovim.

This project aims to:

*Bring real vim bindings to Atom.
*Give the redraw-events neovim patch and the sendkey patch a work out and find
issues using the msgpack api.
*Eventually build an editor that I would find useful. At the current state it is
pre-alpha.
